## Day 1-2: C\*ns\*r\*d Str\*ngs 
Someone has attempted to censor my strings by replacing every vowel with a `'*'` (`l*k* th*s`). Luckily, I've been able to find the vowels that were removed.  
Given a censored string and a string of the censored vowels, return the original uncensored string.
### Examples
* `Uncensor("Wh*r* d*d my v*w*ls g*?", "eeioeo")` -> `"Where did my vowels go?"`
* `Uncensor("abcd", "")` -> `"abcd"`
* `Uncensor("*PP*RC*S*", "UEAE")` -> `"UPPERCASE"`
