## Day 12: Staircase Troubles *(hard)*
There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
### Example
* `StairsPossibilities(4)` -> `5`  
In this case, there are five unique ways to climb the staircase:
  * `[1,1,1,1]`
  * `[2,1,1]`
  * `[1,2,1]`
  * `[1,1,2]`
  * `[2,2]`

Done [X]  
Bonus: What if instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at the time, you voulf climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = `[1,3,5]`, you could climb 1, 3 or 5 steps at a time. [X]
