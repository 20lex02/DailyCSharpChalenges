## Day 3-1: Smooth Sentences (Hard)
A smooth sentence is a sentence where the last letter of each word is identical to the first letter of the following word (and not case sensitive, so `'A'` would be the same as `'a'`).  
\
The following would be a smooth sentence `"Carlos swam masterfully"` because `"Carlos"` ends with an `'s'` and `"swam"` starts with an `'s'`, and so on.  
\
Create a function that determines wether the input sentence is a smooth sentence, returning the boolean value `true` if it is, or `false` if it is not.
### Examples
* `IsSmooth("Marta appreciated deep perpendicular right trapezoids")` -> `true`
* `IsSmooth("Someone is outside the doorway")` -> `false`
* `IsSmooth("She eats super righteously")` -> `true`
