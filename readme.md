# DailyCSharpChallenges
This repository contains daily C# challenges, along with my (probably non-optimal) take on them.
## Global requirements
You need to have the following installed:
* .NET 6.0
* An IDE (preferably Visual Studio Code)
## Requirements (Visual Studio Code)
I highly recommended to use visual studio code with this repository, as an interactive launch configuration is already set-up.  
#### The following VS Code extensions are required:
* Command Variable (rioj7.command-variable).  
* C# (ms-dotnettools.csharp).
## Execution guide
In order to run a specific daily challenge, I recommend using the `Run and Debug` menu of VS Code, and then running the `.NET Core Launch dayX`. A prompt should appear, asking you which day you want to run. Enter the daily challenge you want to run (ie 1, 1-1, etc.), and it should run the specified daily challenge.  
## Legal mention
I am not responsible if the code causes damage to your computer, and it is provided as-is. Otherwise, feel free to use my code wherever you want.
